# Configuration file for a trivial NAMO problem instance that just involves moving one can to a certain position. Used as a simple sanity check test case.
# Blank lines and lines beginning with # are filtered out.

# The values after each attribute name are the values that get passed into the __init__ method for that attribute's class defined in the domain configuration.
