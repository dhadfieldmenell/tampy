Put Kinematics folder in your ~/.openrave file so openrave can load the iksolver from it.
Try this first:
Place kinematics.a9244a345a56872b76cadb57277d0618 in your home directory's .openrave directory. This should be compatible with recent versions of openrave.

For older versions of the codebase:
This iksolver file has to match following model and openrave version

1. Corresponding Baxter Model Hash: cc1f481618b80f78c7d4068a2a9b1212
2. With Ikfast version: 69
3. Corresponding Openrave Github commit: 38a20cf3a8c612efd8c3dfab9c6220ee7a273237
